# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Overview
This project is now configured with React Router DOM's HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility. Hash-based routing ensures all routes work correctly when deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Current Configuration

### ‚úÖ Completed Setup
- **React Router DOM**: Installed and configured with HashRouter
- **Navigation**: Updated to use React Router DOM components (NavLink, useLocation)
- **Build Process**: Successfully tested - creates optimized production build in `dist/public/`
- **gh-pages**: Installed as dev dependency for deployment

### üìù Required Package.json Updates

To complete the GitHub Pages setup, you need to manually add these to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name",
  "scripts": {
    "build:client": "NODE_ENV=production vite build",
    "predeploy": "npm run build:client",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist/public"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Update your package.json
- Add the `homepage` field with your GitHub Pages URL
- Add the build and deployment scripts shown above

### 2. Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
# Build and deploy in one command
npm run deploy

# Or manually:
npm run build:client
npx gh-pages -d dist/public
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Repository
1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" section  
3. Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select the `gh-pages` branch
5. Your app will be available at the homepage URL

## How It Works

### Hash Routing
- URLs use hash format: `https://your-site.com/#/profile`
- GitHub Pages serves `index.html` for all routes
- React Router handles navigation client-side
- Perfect for static hosting environments

### Build Output
- Production build creates optimized files in `dist/public/`
- Includes all assets, CSS, and JavaScript bundles
- Ready for static hosting deployment

### Deployment Process
1. `npm run build:client` - Creates production build
2. `gh-pages -d dist/public` - Deploys build folder to gh-pages branch
3. GitHub Pages automatically serves from gh-pages branch

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **404 on routes**: Ensure you're using HashRouter (already configured)
- **Assets not loading**: Check homepage field matches your GitHub Pages URL
- **Build fails**: Run `npm run build:client` to test build process

### Verification
- ‚úÖ Hash symbol (#) appears in URLs when navigating
- ‚úÖ Page refreshes work correctly on any route
- ‚úÖ Direct URL access works for all routes

## Next Steps
1. Update your package.json with the required fields
2. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages
3. Configure your GitHub repository Pages settings
4. Your React app will be live on GitHub Pages!
